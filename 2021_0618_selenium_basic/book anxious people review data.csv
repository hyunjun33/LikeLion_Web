I thought this was a stunning novel, he is hands down one of my favorite authors and I found Anxious People to be incredible!Perhaps this is a story about a hostage situation, anxious people, idiots, an apartment viewing, a police investigation, a bridge.Perhaps this is a story about human relationships, which is something Backman writes about masterfully. This one was no exception, I laughed, I cried, I savored every word and page. Another brilliant novel by one of the best!"
1,Patti,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"September 12, 2020",198 people found this helpful,"Oh my gosh I loved this book - more than I loved A Man Called Ove.  You could say that this book was how a bank robber failed to rob a bank but instead managed to spark a hostage drama.  I would describe it as 'Everyone you know is fighting a battle you know nothing about'.  The reason the bank robber wants to rob the bank is heartbreaking.  There were also plenty of moments when I laughed out loud.  There are many nuggets of wisdom.  There is also a bit of mystery; you learn bits about the different people as you read and need to put the pieces together.  Also, what happened to the bank robber?This is one of my many highlights, ""Grandchildren would make him feel important?” Anna-Lena smiled weakly. “Have you ever held a three-year-old by the hand on the way home from preschool?” “No.” “You’re never more important than you are then.”"""

This book touches your heart and soul and that is so important in this year of 2020.  I highly recommend this book and love this author!  He reaches deep!
3,Schinnie,2.0,Reviewed in the United States,"September 30, 2020",144 people found this helpful,"Oh my gosh is this the same Fredrik Bachman who wrote the wonderful Bear Town/ Us Against You??? What is the purpose of this book on these so called anxious people? I couldn’t make it to the first 100 pages. The dialogues are so meaningless but a bunch of ramblings about these characters who are totally lack of appeal. I feel the author is trying to build up something big but do not care for his style. Feeling very impatient and agonizingly slow with the silly conversations. No connection to this book at all. The interview parts are especially painful and they are NOT even funny, far from it. I really couldn’t get through this book. What a disappointment from one of the most anticipated books in my list."

I had to force myself to put it down long enough to get anything done around my house.

5,Palmeroy,1.0,Reviewed in the United States,"September 23, 2020",123 people found this helpful,"This was a book for my book club and I really wanted to like it. I enjoyed the author's previous books. I liked the opening few pages and thought it was going to be fun to read. But soon it became torture. I didn't care for the style of writing, the characters were annoying and it was depressing. I gave up about a third of the way through. Most of my book club said they didn't like the first 3/4 of the book, but it got really good in the last 1/4 as everything came together. Then you understood why people behaved the way they did in the earlier part. The problem for me is why struggle thru 3/4 of a book just to get to the good part."

A hostage situation that might not be a hostage situation. Yet, there is intent, a mask, and a gun involved.Eight stranger's anxieties that are all in one apartment viewing when a masked individual walks in, a suicide, a psychologist, and two cops trying to get to the bottom of it all, becomes the perfect mixture for a good novel.Surprisingly funny and sad with moments of revelation is what Anxious People delivers to this reader. I became engrossed in the life of these people. How fate has put them all together in one place to bring out all of their issues into the open.Anxiuos People has a true message. A good person can make a bad decision. Should the bad decision define us? Should we get a second chance? We have all been ""idiots"" at one point. Right?I encourage people to read this book. It is not the usual prose I'm used to but it works nonetheless.Cliffhanger: No4/5 Fangs"

It was hard and sad and happy and good and silly and all the loveliness that warms you and makes you cry when you read a Backman book. Backman just has a magic way of writing about people that are so real that they take up space in your heart. Anxious People felt intimate and thoughtful. With thoughts we all think and hurts we all feel. Worn by people we all know. And the overall theme of our need for each other that you find in all of Backman’s books was there, familiar and comforting as ever."
8,abby,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"September 13, 2020",40 people found this helpful,"“This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiots.”I’ve read most of Fredrik Backman’s books and this one is very on-brand for him. The writing is sweet and funny and has heart. It’s full of zany characters who connect through a series of extraordinary coincidences. There’s the curmudgeon (or two) with heart of gold and the flighty young person (or two) with more sense than it seems. Lots tragic backstories and dead loved ones who seem alive until the author informs you otherwise. The ending is happy. You’ll feel things. You might even cry.I don’t think book is as good as some of Backman’s previous efforts (“A Man Called Ove” and “Beartown”). The concept is good: the world’s most reluctant bank robber accidentally robs a cashless bank and winds up taking a group of people at an open house hostage, and they are the worst hostages ever. It’s just a tad too much. Too much coincidence. Too much cuteness. Too many many aha! moments. I know what I’m getting into with Backman, but this book could have benefited from just a touch of realism.Overall, I enjoyed this book, some parts more than others. I think it’s worth reading, but if you’re new to Backman, pick up “A Man Called Ove” instead."

11,DWC,1.0,Reviewed in the United States,"December 27, 2020",21 people found this helpful,"""Anxious People, by Fredrik Backman was a highly disappointing novel. The premise was enticing, a hostage situation following a botched robbery, but the book failed to live up to the hype.There are several discrepancies in the book. On page 274 we are told the pistol is not real. If so, how did it fire a shot later on? We are given contradictory information regarding the gender of the bank robber. On page 274 and 292, we are told it is a woman. On page 269 and 270, we are told it is a man. Come on, Backman, make up your mind.The author withholds critical information from the reader as well. At first, we see two policemen arguing with each other. We then are told they are father and son, which explains the conflict. Why not just tell the reader that information up front? To withhold the information creates confusion.I had great difficulty remaining engaged with the book. The first half was a bore. If I didn't hate to DNF a books so much, I would have given up on this one. Overall, the story did not ring true to me and the ending was unsatisfying. It was too neatly wrapped up.The dialog was horrible. Most of the characters sounded alike, especially the father and son police duo.  The poor dialogue led to me not being able to establish a bond with any of the characters, so I really did not care for any of them. The characters were poorly developed. I never felt like I knew any of them.Save your time and money. Skip this read"

There are 10 central characters each of whom is presented with sketchy details that are revealed gradually over the course of the narrative. I found myself constantly looking to see how many pages I had left to slog through. Reading should engage the reader, not put him off. Great premise, one that falls apart in the story telling.

The story is meant to be gripping as we learn more about the characters involved, but I never really cared about any of them. I get what the author was trying to do but I found that I was forcing myself to read this book to finish it, not because I was actually enjoying the unfolding story. I'd pick something else to read."
15,John K. Mainieri,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"September 13, 2020",19 people found this helpful,"This novel is pure magic. It may be about a bank robbery gone wrong, or it might be about people taken hostage by the bank robber, or it just might be about love and marriage, and spending your life with one person until that person is gone. It might be about the things people do for love, and how much they’re willing to go through to not be alone. It might be about the man on the bridge and the boy who tried to save him and what took place ten years later. But it’s probably about living day to day and the joy of finding a novel like this one. The joy of finding this very one."
16,Paddler,1.0,Reviewed in the United States,"December 18, 2020",17 people found this helpful,"The initial plot and writing style felt very promising, but things went steadily downhill from there.First, it became apparent that the author could not come up with reasonable dialogs between his characters.  Not only were they not plausible, but there seemed to be no point or purpose to these conversations.  It was hard not to conclude that this is an author who thinks he is cleverer - than he really is.Second, his observations and insights about the human condition, of which there are many, were often snarky, and in my opinion too often ""missed the mark"".  I might have tolerated some of the ridiculous dialog if some truely good insights were thrown into the mix, but unfortunately this really wasn't the case.  I stopped about ⅓ through the book because I just couldn't justify spending any more time on it.I had the impression that this author might have been a college student, with lots of energy and good ideas, but lacking the maturity and knowledge of human relationships that improves with age.  Maybe it was his first book, in which case I would have offered lots of encouragement for him to continue writing.  But now I've found out that he has written many books.  I can only conclude that this book was disappointing."
17,sb-lynn,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"September 21, 2020",15 people found this helpful,"Brief summary and review, no spoilers.This book is the story of a really maladroit bank robber. Or maybe it’s the story of some inept hostages. Or wait, it is the story of 1 or maybe 2 people who tried to jump off a bridge. Well maybe it’s even a locked-room mystery novel in the traditional sense and we’ve got 2 wonderful policemen to boot. Oh, and Scandinavians. Don’t let me forget to mention Scandinavians.And that’s all I am going to say about the plot. The storyline is told in different short chapters often from the viewpoint of almost every character. The chapters go back and forth in time and we not only solve the mystery but we get to meet a bunch of the most likable characters ever written.This book was an extraordinary reading experience for me. I have read all of Fredrik Backman’s books and liked them all,  and this one is my favorite yet.Backman has amazing writing chops and I have dog-eared so many pages of this book because they are so clever and profound and very, very funny. I laughed on almost every page and as cliche as it sounds, I teared up a lot too.This book is so many things at one time. It was an absolute page-turner but I made myself slow down because I was having so much fun reading it.  And that’s saying a lot as I am writing this review in 2020 with all its challenges - I have had some trouble getting into books as much as usual.When I finished the last chapter, I had one of those “reader’s highs” - as I call them; that wonderful feeling you have after reading something so exceptional and wonderful and in this case, even profound.I cannot recommend this book enough."
18,Print MD,3.0,Reviewed in the United States,"September 22, 2020",14 people found this helpful,"SEPT 2020  :  3 STARS.  Looking at real estate isn't usually a life-or-death situation but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage.Prior books by this author for me were A Man Called Ove ('14 - Read '17 - 4 Stars), Bear Towns ('16 - 5 Stars), My Grandmother Asked Me To Tell You She's Sorry ('15 - Read '17 - 2 Stars) and Us Against You ('18 - 5 Stars).  I started a sample of this book first because I heard there were a lot of characters.  It was easy to keep them straight.  I like how this author develops his characters.  Little pieces of this puzzle are coming together constantly.  The author himself calls these characters ""idiots""; I can see why.  At 65% the conversations between Zara and her psychologist are sooo stupid, they're driving me crazy; maybe there just above me.  Somehow I finished this book but don't know why.  I was frustrated & disappointed while reading.  I was happy with the outcome but the whole journey to get there was a waste for me.  After pondering, I think the moral of this story was to take notice of what you have in life.  Because of that thought, I gave it a 3."

22,Mr. Joe,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"October 20, 2020",9 people found this helpful,"“This is a story about a bridge, and idiots, and a hostage drama, and an apartment viewing. But it’s also a love story. Several, in fact.” – from ANXIOUS PEOPLE“We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.” – from ANXIOUS PEOPLEANXIOUS PEOPLE by Fedrik Backman begins as a novel of the absurd revolving around an idiosyncratic plot set in a very small Swedish town on New Year’s Eve: a clueless robber attempts a heist from a cash-less bank and then, when the police are called, flees across the street and upstairs into an apartment for sale being shown by a realtor to a handful of diverse potential buyers, all of whom the fugitive reluctantly takes hostage. The police arriving at the scene are a dysfunctional father and son team. A subplot involves a psychologist and one of the hostages.ANXIOUS PEOPLE is also, as Backman states, about idiots, his definition of which encompasses pretty much all of us …“Because everyone loves someone, and anyone who loves someone has had those desperate nights where we like awake trying to figure out how we can afford carrying on being human beings. Sometimes that makes us do things that seem ridiculous in hindsight, but which felt like the only way out at the time.”Oh, yes.The book certainly starts out with the promise of an essay on absurdity’s drollness, especially in the way the narrative flows from the author’s pen. As the plot then evolved, it seemed to me excessively drawn out and approaching a tedious silliness. But then, like Saul on the Damascus Road, I was suddenly enlightened – well, maybe not so suddenly.ANXIOUS PEOPLE is an inciteful – perhaps at times profoundly so – story about the human condition as it relates to the relationships between people that serve – or should serve - as stabilizers on the journey of living. Whereas I was tempted at one point to award the book a mediocre three stars, I finished thinking four. The only reason I’m not awarding five is that I thought the epilogue to the story’s core event too prolonged. Sometimes less, with a bit of residual mystery or uncertainty, is better.The reader is cautioned not to make assumptions about the characters – or their anxieties. (The book is, after all, entitled ANXIOUS PEOPLE.)The reader is best left with the thought to reflect upon:“… that’s the greatest loneliness in the world: when no one is walking beside you toward your destination.”"

24,Clauser1960,1.0,Reviewed in the United States,"December 27, 2020",8 people found this helpful,"As I discovered soon, the author is Swedish and the story  - a comedy - is set in Sweden. That must be the reason why nobody is responsible - or guilty, God forbids - for anything. Everybody  is an innocent, poor victim of (unrealistic) circumstances. Each character is extremely egocentric and dysfunctional. Not even one of the ""hostages"" is able to hold a nornal conversation as a witness with the 2 policemen: they are ALL spoiled, hyper self centered, defiant, aggressive and insulting, like unruly adolescents.I dropped the book at half because I could not take anymore of so much dysfunctional and destructive nonsense. The problem of the author and of those characters  is not ""the system"" but their own collective ideology."
25,Navy mom,1.0,Reviewed in the United States,"December 1, 2020",10 people found this helpful,"I am on page 90 and probably won't finish this book. I have enjoyed previous Backman novels, but the writing style of this one is frenetic. It feels like Backman was writing while on massive amounts of caffeine or speed! He attempts to fill the pages with little surprises about how people or events are connected, but in the process drives this reader quite mad!"
26,carolynfromoz,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"September 8, 2020",8 people found this helpful,"Mr Backman has done it again! He's written a book that is seemingly about a ridiculous situation with a bunch of difficult people but he's made us laugh and made us cry and love those people with their anxieties and human flaws.The bulk of the novel takes part at an apartment viewing where two couples, a single woman, an elderly woman, a rabbit and a real estate agent accidently become hostages when a failed bank robber runs in looking for an escape route. Initially the hostages are difficult to like. The couples are anxious about being able to buy the apartment and niggling at each other, one of the single women is a lonely bank manager who doesn't like people, the real estate agent is nervous about not being very good at her job and the elderly woman has her own anxieties. The rabbit isn't having a good day either. They don't act like good hostages either, ignoring the bank robber despite having a gun waved at them. But somehow, in his inimitable way, Mr Backman has us caring about these people and their relationships and anxieties. He is able to drill deep below the surface of each of them to expose their humanity and show us what makes each of them so special and he's able to do it while having us laughing one minute at the quirky humor of it all and next with tears in our eyes over something poignant and touching.The police aren't having a good day either. Father and son, Jim the old hand and Jack preferring modern methods, make up most of the small police force in their small town. They're not used to bank robbers or handling hostage situations, but they can't wait for detectives to come from Stockholm. Their interviews with the hostages after they are released, interspersed through the narrative, are hilarious. There was so much to love about this novel and remember afterwords - the connection with bridge, the pizza, the closet, the fireworks and the ending which was just perfect. I hope Mr Backman goes on to write many more beautiful books like this."
27,Lynne,2.0,Reviewed in the United States,"December 9, 2020",8 people found this helpful,"OMG  What a huge disappointment!  I am stunned by the rave reviews.  If you love cliches, over used metaphors, and out of date homilies then this book is meant for you.  This is the tripe that might appeal to a not too bright adolescent.  If you are a huge fan of Garrison Keillor, this may be your cup of tea.  Though it is not even as funny as Keillor.It gets 2 stars because the plot idea is clever.  That is the reason I kept reading.  But beyond the plot one must wade through endless pages of total romantic drivel."
28,Natasha Hinkson,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"January 4, 2021",6 people found this helpful,"4.5 stars rounded up.Well this was a very ‘different’ book, which I personally loved, but I would not rush to recommend to just anyone (reasons listed below).For me, a book that can make me laugh out loud numerous times, and also spring tears at other times deserves numerous stars. What expressive writing exploring so many relevant themes in the lives of ordinary people who coincidentally happen to be in the same place at the same time.This book was translated from Swedish to English and I was so impressed with the diverse use of language. The writing was so clever and witty on the surface but so filled with emotion just laying right there beneath the comedy. The book could be about so much, depends on what you want to take away from it. For me the underlying theme of desperation is what spoke to me from beneath the hilarity of the presentation of the stories of each character.Redemption, hope, loneliness, betrayal, suicide are among other themes explored, juxtaposed against an absolutely amusing narrative so that you never really feel that heaviness that usually accompanies such topics. And isn’t this just how anxiety works?? Usually lurking just beneath the surface of a happy face.So why isn’t this book for everyone? Well, the plot was so/so...kind of conveniently structured with too many coincidences. The characters, although perfectly developed, were for the most part not likeable (I found them so amusing that it didn’t matter). Apart from being difficult to like, the characters were all just ‘too damaged’, no one was ‘just ordinary’. The police interview narrative became overbearing to the point of annoyance (this was the one thing I didn’t like). The first chunk of the book was dedicated to character development (there were numerous characters) so it really took a while for the story to start coming together.I found the story reminiscent of the movie “The Breakfast Club” in many ways. A cast of flawed characters who become stuck together not by choice and who bond (or don’t) in unexpected ways.PS This story is about a bridge (that PS is for those who have read the book)."
29,olmy,2.0,Reviewed in the United States,"October 22, 2020",7 people found this helpful,"the beginning of the story was nice, that's why I bought it, but then it goes into the same thing over and over again. You know after the first 20 pages what's going on and then it drags along. You wait for something to happen, but it comes back to the same thing, over and over. The ending is a little bit surprising, if as somebody would have said, 'please put  at least some spice to the ending, otherwise you can forget the book'. I read OVE from this author and kind of liked it. This was another reason to buy it, but somehow his style is repeating. It was in certain respect OVE with different people. For me it was the last book I read from him. Maybe he can only write one thing. A good author should be more versatile."

It was tough go at first because everyone and everything seemed so weird and disjointed. I kept going because I had read and loved “A Man Called Ove.” When I started reading “…Ove,”, I immediately felt in tune with Fredrik Backman’s way of making quirky characters seem so relatable and I had expected to feel such instant affinity with “Anxious People.” Plus, I hate to quit on a book before the end. It wasn’t until nearly three-quarters of the way through “Anxious People” that I found myself absolutely falling in love with the story. It all came together so beautifully, with such life-affirming positivity. This is a book about life, about love, and about letting yourself care. It’s about caring, not just for others, but also about others. It’s a book about caring for yourself, forgiving yourself, finding the truth about yourself. It’s about interconnectedness. We are all, in some way or another, connected. Few books have left me with such a deep feeling of satisfaction, optimism, and joy."

This book does both.  After about a third of the book I ran out of patience.

38,Frank Donnelly,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"April 4, 2021",2 people found this helpful,"""Anxious People"" is a very clever, witty, heart warming work of fiction authored by Swedish author, Fredrik Backman.  The story is set in Sweden. It is of medium length and clearly written, although there are numerous characters and various storylines.  In that context the story often demanded my complete attention.I have previously only read one novel by Mister Backman; ""A Man Called Ove"".  I also completely enjoyed that novel.  Although the stories are completely different, there are some stylistic similarities.  If one has enjoyed ""Ove"" as I did, then one might enjoy this novel to a similar extent.Mister Backman tells a story that has certain ironic twists.  A reader can begin to draw one conclusion and then discover in short order that he/she had come to a premature, mistaken, conclusion.  I find these slight misdirections enjoyable and they make me think.  However I do not feel that they come at my expense and I can enjoy the momentary confusion.The author also causes me to really like certain characters.  I identify with them, and care about what happens to them.  I find some of the storylines quite touching.  Although the author does not write a great deal about scenery, when he does so I also feel he is very gifted in depicting scenery.  Some readers tell me that they don't care so much about scenery.  I enjoy such narrative very much.At the same time, the author has a clever sense of humor.  I purchased an audiobook and read and listened simultaneously, as I often do.  I found the narrator, Marin Ireland, to be quite professional.  She gave different voices to different characters and had an excellent sense of comedic timing that enhanced my reading experience.  I am not one to suggest lightly that one spend extra money.  I emphasize that I did pay the full standard retail price for both products.  I did so in this case and was glad that I both read and listened.In summary, I was very glad that I read and listened to this book on Kindle and Audiobook.  I have now read and thoroughly enjoyed two novels by Fredrik Backman.  I find his style in the two books similar enough that I intend to take a break before reading a third novel of his.  But it is more than fair to say Mister Backman is one of my favorite authors of contemporary light fiction.  Thank You for taking the time to read this review."
39,David W Putnam,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"January 16, 2021",2 people found this helpful,"This author has a great talent and I will read anything he writes.I loved, loved A Man Called Ov so maybe my expectations were set a little too high on Anxious People. I did enjoy this book a great deal and would recommend it to anyone. The concept is unique, a bank robbery investigated by a father and son and their conflicts. This would’ve been five stars had the backstory of “The bank robber,” not been in second person. This structure not only stopped the forward motion of the story but for me it was like fingernails on a chalkboard. I have no problem with first person, third person and third person close, second person tossed me out of the story and held me at arm’s length.In the first part of the book the author doesn’t stay with anyone character long enough for the reader to relate to them. For me this is critically important for establishing what I need most out of a book, The Fictive Dream, a state where I become immersed in the story. During the opening pages of most books authors are tasked with endearing the reader to the character, what I’ve heard described as, “Patting the head of the dog.”The big reason this book works and is so popular is the author’s credibility, he is a wonderful talent who readers trust implicitly and are willing to give him a few pages to set up the story. The book really digs in on page 107 so hold out a little longer if tempted to put it down, you won’t regret it. Four out of five stars.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson Series"
40,JBenoit,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"January 16, 2021",2 people found this helpful,"The theme for January in my 2021 “diversify your reading” challenge was Literary Fiction. I found this book in the bestseller list for that category and the title spoke to me - after all, anxiety has basically been the theme of the last 10 months! The blurb intrigued me so I ordered it and decided to give it a go. On the surface, this was a story about a failed bank robbery that ended up turning an apartment open house into the most bizarre hostage situation ever. What it turned out to be, however, was a charming, quirky, and insightful novel about human nature, forgiveness, hope, and what happens when you take the time to truly listen to others.The way this story was woven together was very clever. It jumps all over the timeline and goes off on a lot of tangents but it all makes sense in the end and every little tidbit we learn becomes important at some point during the story. At times funny, at times heartbreaking, this story took difficult topics and handled them in a way that was impactful yet lighthearted. It was a fascinating narrative that kept me flipping the pages.The bank robbery and hostage drama are just mechanisms to bring this eclectic cast of characters together. It was a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of them but what happens during their time together turns out to be life-changing for each and every one of them. From an older married couple on the brink of divorce to a young couple about to become parents for the first time, an elderly woman and a wealthy banker who are just at the apartment viewing for kicks, a flustered real estate agent and a man in a rabbit mask - this is a strange bunch. Then we’ve got a father/son cop duo trying to diffuse the situation and a handful of other secondary characters who ultimately play important roles as well. Everyone has their own issues and secrets and at first look, these people were pretty insufferable. But as we take the time to get to know them better and understand their motivations and desires, they become almost endearing and you start to root for them. It was an interesting shift and fascinating to see all these new friendships and bonds form in a group of once strangers who may have never given each other the time of day had they not been forced together.Overall I was really entertained by this book. It took many turns that I wasn’t expecting because of certain assumptions you will automatically make (you’ll understand what I mean if you read it!). And there are so many little tidbits and insights throughout that will make you think and reflect on your own life and relationships. I had never read anything from this author but I enjoyed his writing style and will have to look into some of his other stories!"
41,TapTheLine,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"October 16, 2020",3 people found this helpful,"""This is a story about a bank robbery, an apartment viewing and a hostage drama. But even more it's a story about idiots. But perhaps not only that."" (Chapter 27)Fredrik Backman is one of the most gifted contemporary Swedish storytellers and he is widely known for his novel, A Man Called Ove, which has been adapted into a film by Hannes Holm, starring the veteran actor, Rolf Lassgård as the grumpy, borderline misanthropist, Ove. Both the book and the movie gained critical acclaim and there is also an American remake coming soon, with Tom Hanks as the protagonist. What fascinated the audiences was Ove's peculiar idiosyncrasy as well as the great outline of the secondary characters, a kind of trademark for Backman. He is an author that is oriented towards the lives of the ordinary people, their struggles, anguishes and questions that remain unanswered no matter how often they are being raised during a lifetime. In Anxious People, Backman uses the crime element as a facade to tackle several universal and amaranthine themes such as depression, suicide, what it really means to grow up, how hard it is for the average man to meet the standards that the postmodern societies set in order to distinguish the successful from the failure and many others. All the above are presented through a gripping prose that is full of hilarious dialogue and remarks made by the main characters in this odd story of a botched bank robbery that leads to an odd hostage situation where the role of perpetrator and victim often interchanges. If one reads the synopsis of the book, he will think that this is a typical crime story, full of action and suspense but this is not the case here. Backman, once again, delves into his fictional characters' deeper thoughts that are instantly discernible by the reader who himself had often had the same thoughts and concerns. Nevertheless, you should keep in mind that Anxious People is primarily a comical novel, sometimes downright hilarious, and you will laugh many times reading the exceptional description and dialogue.The story sets off when a first-time bank robber chooses to storm into a cashless bank to get the limited amount of six thousand and five hundred Swedish Kroner. Soon he realizes his mistake and when is evident that the bank has no banknotes, he attempts to escape in a nearby building. In his fury, he gets in an apartment where a viewing is held for prospective buyers. Holding a pistol in his hand and wearing a balaclava to hide his face, he looks terrifying enough in the beginning, though very quickly he proves to be a rather unstable individual with no experience as a criminal. The hostages, who are the people that happened to be inside the apartment for the viewing at that time, are a rather distinctive group of people and each one of them has some unique character traits that will be revealed as the story progresses. The police officers that are charged with the investigation of this parody of hostage-taking are Jim and Jack, father and son, who both work in the small town's precinct and are thirsty for an opportunity to show to their bosses and their colleagues in Stockholm that they can handle cases of larger magnitude like this one. Jack and Jim have a rather dysfunctional relationship and their communication is often terminated due to a wrong choice of words, or an inappropriate remark made by one of them. Their blood relation doesn't help them much in their professional lives and besides, they are completely different as characters.Backman uses a mixed narrative style that begins chronologically from the end of the hostage situation and in the following chapters talks about the events and interactions that took place inside the apartment after the failed robbery attempt. Furthermore, he interposes witness statements taken from the hostages by Jack and Jim. The small chapters add to an already fast tempo, that makes reading smoother and highly engaging. What is most remarkable about this book is the vast number of insights on the human condition that are scattered throughout the text and I couldn't stop making notes on my Kindle from the beginning till the very end. This was my first reading experience with this author, I've already seen A Man Called Ove in the cinema, and I'm literally thrilled by his craftmanship as far as both characterization and dialogue are concerned. Backman's writing style is refreshing and stimulating and I cannot think of another writer that comes even close to his ingenious prose. Another novel of his, Beartown, has been adapted into the television and I will immediately check it out. If you aren't familiar with his body of work, Anxious People would be an ideal start."
42,Norma B,3.0,Reviewed in the United States,"December 11, 2020",4 people found this helpful,"I have read and enjoyed most of Backman's novels.  Anxious People was not his usual style.  When I started reading, I was thinking, ""huh.?"".  After a few chapters, I was ready to give up.  The character and plot development was very strange.  It seemed as though I was reading a slapstick comedy.  Just as I was about it give up, the story line started to make sense and I finished the book.  This book isn't one I would recommend to other Backman readers.  Adrwe all that had gone on between and among the characters the ""wrapup"" Chapter was mostly predictable.  Thinking further, I would put it in the category of a Hallmark  movie.  And a ""happy ending"" was had by all.  Too sweet to be reality."

It was a group of odd characters thrown together at an apartment viewing and then held hostage by a bank robber.  The story kept reverting back to a person jumping off a bridge 10 years before  and a lot of the people had connections to that time.  The story was long, wordy, and boring."

45,Jean Cole,2.0,Reviewed in the United States,"February 16, 2021",3 people found this helpful,"This book started off pretty well but soon became almost a comedy although it is actually about a very serious subject I.e a bank robbery.  The author introduces us to a group of unrelated individuals who are attending a real-estate “open-house” during a holiday weekend in an unidentified city in Sweden.  They are joined by a would-be bank robber.  Their back-stories and interaction form the main story line.  Although the author is certainly a skilled writer, the story he created is so improbable that I think it was meant to be a not-very- funny comedy.  Don’t bother reading it."
46,Karen,1.0,Reviewed in the United States,"March 30, 2021",2 people found this helpful,"I had high hopes for this book but just couldn’t get past how annoying and rude the characters are.  I made it 1/2 way through and returned the title.  This is only the 3rd time in my life that I’ve started a book and didn’t finish.  I usually stick it out even if I don’t like the book.  In this case the rude way that the 3rd witness being interviewed responded to the cops made me decide that I just didn’t care about the Characters and couldn’t take how disrespectful and annoying they were.  I normally like satirical snarky humor but this book was annoying as opposed to funny.  And yes, I have repeated the word, “annoying” multiple times in this review but that is because it is the best adjective to describe this book."
47,JCC,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"October 7, 2020",One person found this helpful,"After reading several tragic, depressing novels I needed a book with some levity.  Anxious People filled the bill.  Fredrik Bachman Is masterful in his delivery of quirky people.  The story takes place primarily in one place, an apartment that is for sale.  On the day of its open house a group of people is gathered to take a tour but due to an unexpected occurrence, they are forced to remain in the apartment together until the situation is resolved.  Each person in this rather small place has a story (one or more) and as their lives are revealed, along with their own anxieties, it is obvious that they are getting to know each other very well. This is a story of humanity, with all of its foibles, distrust, love and everything that makes us “human” revealed.  It is a fun read and the questions offered at the end helped me to realize that the story was not superficial or strictly to be read for entertainment.  It offers the reader a chance to do some introspection into his or her own possible anxieties.  Definitely, a fun read!"
48,AmberEatsBooks,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"September 27, 2020",One person found this helpful,"This was such a different reading experience. First, I listened to the audiobook. I haven’t consumed a Backman book in that way before. I really liked the narrator but there was something about how the story started that made it a little hard to connect to right away. It was interesting so I kept going and I’m really glad I did. This is a story that slowly weaves itself together. As it combines the different threads of the story, the reader begins to understand how neatly everything fits together. My enjoyment grew as the plot moved along. By the time I reached the end, I realized just how invested I had been all along. It’s a book that I would love to go back and reread with the information I have now to see if I can pull new things from it. This is not my all time favorite Backman book (that title is still held by Beartown) but it is a solid, enjoyable addition to his body of work.Thank you to Libro.fm for providing me with an Advanced Listening Copy. The audiobook was wonderful!TW: Suicide"
49,Kindle Customer,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"September 16, 2020",3 people found this helpful,In a time that feels like we are more distant that ever from each - Backman reminds us of the goodness of humanity.  I am an avid reader and Backman's books are by far my favorite - this book is no exception.  While this one took me a while to get into due to the narrative style - I soon could not put it down.  As others have mentioned - this is not the story of a kidnapping but about kindness among strangers.  Read it - you will not regret it.
50,Constant Reader,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"October 17, 2020",One person found this helpful,"Fredrik Backman writes books where the pages turn quickly. But it is worth slowing down to pay attention. His keen insight and highly perceptive story telling are camouflaged within stories that can feel light even as they move you to tears. This standalone story is one of his best. The book begins with a bank robbery motivated by desperation. It is a very bad bank robbery since the target bank has no cash and the robber makes a poor escape into a real estate open house in an apartment on the top floor of the building across the street. Most of the story is in the hostage situation. They are all anxious people even outside of a hostage situation. They each have their worries, insecurities, doubts, and griefs. To tell more would be to ruin the story for you. Bottom line: the author is a talented writer with a unique voice and the book is well worth reading."
51,Kindle Customer,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"December 27, 2020",One person found this helpful,"Although not  to  the  extent of  A Man Called Ove, Anxious People demonstrates Backman's  unique gift for making the strange ones, the grumpy ones, those who have chosen to.distance themselves  from others, particularly the people the world has damaged, appear to show the layers of  vulnerability which are really who they/we are -- qualities that  allow us to empathize with ,even love , them.  I  was slow to warm to this book. Give it time to work to.work  it's magic. Backman knows what he is doing. The reader needs to.have patience with the process. This is the fourth book of his I've read. It is my second from favorite (Ove).  The writing is sure and will take you where he wants you to go. The journey is the most interesting part. Not the destination. Trust the author."
52,LindaL,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"April 17, 2021",0 people found this helpful,"On the surface, Anxious People is about a failed bank robbery, a hostage situation, and the local police’s inability to investigate what happened. It takes place in Sweden, and Backman uses humor to draw us into a story about what happens when a group of people who show up for an apartment open house is forced to talk to each other, show their vulnerabilities and address their anxieties. In actuality, the story is about the foolishness, or idiocy, as Backman calls it,  of the human psyche as people navigate life.Jim and Jack are a father/son police team who play out generational differences in their approaches to interviewing witnesses. They convey many of the inherent problems associated with making assumptions and drawing conclusions based on preconceived notions. However, I  sympathized with them since the interviewees/witnesses in their case were purposely evasive and deceptive. The more we find out about the would-be bank robber, the more we understand the dilemma that led to the crime, and eventually, we realize that the hostages hardly see themselves as victims.Backman creates characters that are realistic, unfulfilled, uptight, and anxious. It is interesting to witness the dynamics that Backman creates for two couples: Anna-Lena and Roger and Rio and Julia. When they share their backstories and motivations for being at the apartment’s open house, we realize that although individuals may be unique, there is commonality and zaniness in how people show their love for each other. It is also amazing to realize what pretenses people develop to avoid conflict in their relationships.We also see clear examples of the inability to face conflict, communicate, and have relationships when we learn about a banker, Zara, and her life story as discussed with her psychologist, Nadia. Estelle, an 87-year-old woman who is obviously lonely after losing her husband in hilarious when she comforts the bank robber and shares her life with the others, especially the younger women.The physical bridge viewed from the apartment where the action takes place and two suicides that had taken place on the bridge figure into the histories of some of the characters. The realization of the tragedy of suicide leads to a poignant understanding of some of the rawest emotions, and Backman is great at bridging the themes of loneliness, friendship, secrets, and forgiveness. A reader has to appreciate his style of integrating humor with serious topics to explore and appreciate the universal foibles of human nature."
53,Dave Schwinghammer,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"November 14, 2020",0 people found this helpful,"A MAN CALLED OVE is one of the best books I've read in at least ten years or even longer. I was struck by the author's empathy and understanding.There's more of that in ANXIOUS PEOPLE. The unusual premise might bug some readers, though. It's about a non-bank robbery where the robber chooses a cashless bank, then escapes into a nearby apartment building where an open house is going on; the robber reluctantly takes them hostage.This book isn't about any clueless bank robbery; it's about the interaction between the hostages and the robber. Two of the hostages are a lesbian couple. There's another heterosexual couple. When they talk they realize how much they have in common.The robber needs $6500 to rent an apartment and asks for only that amount. We learn that the robber is going through a divorce and is in danger of losing his/her children. He/she also thinks the gun she has is a toy.There's another subplot that eventually connects to some of the hostages. The two detectives negotiating for the freedom of the hostages are a father/son team, Jim and Jake. Jim is really laid back; his son is worried the Stockholmers are going to take away his big chance to solve a case. They would be professional negotiators from Stockholm. Jake has a rather tortured past. He tried to stop a man from committing suicide by jumping off a bridge. The man jumped. Later he tried to stop a young woman from jumping off the same bridge, and he succeeded.Zara is at the open house to see how the other half lives. She could care less about buying an apartment. She is also a banker who turned down a loan that may have caused the first man to jump. She has a letter from him she's afraid to open.If you don't cry at certain parts, especially towards the end, you don't have a heart. Zara's therapist just happens to be the girl Jack stopped from jumping. That's not a spoiler; we learn that fairly early, but there's a “hit you in the heart” connection in the denouement. Oh yeah, I almost forgot; Jim and Jack have a daughter/sister who is hooked on heroin and has let them down time after time. After the bank robber scenario, what are the odds they give her another chance?Throughout most of the book I thought Backman had written a real clunker about an unrealistic bank robbery and too many coincidences, but he made an Aaron Rogers comeback at the end."

On the negative side, the hostage drama and everything that happened afterwards with the police and bank robber was unrealistic and really strange because most adults understand that all actions (especially criminal actions) have consequences, regardless of one’s motivation.  I found it hard to feel a lot of empathyfor the bank robber simply because they were down on their luck and felt desperate because everyone can relate to going through hard times at points in their lives but committing a felony to right a wrong isn’t something that’s easy to understand. With that said, the ending is good and tissues are needed."

I needed Backman’s trademark humor and heart!During a bitterly divided election and the Coronavirus pandemic, enter a novel about loss of CONTROL! How perfect! By now we all should have figured out that control is an illusion/delusion, so sit back and watch the crazy characters in this novel figure it out for themselves.Sure this is a glorious farce, full to the brim with amazing characters; still Backman, in his unique and wonderful way, manages to give us some hard truths about a myriad of relevant modern social topics:LoveMarriageDivorceParentingAnxietyAddictionSuicideSocial MediaThe InternetPredatory financial systems“Anxious People” provides the perfect balance of humor and pathos, and would make a wonderful film! I was mentally casting all the characters in my head the whole time.FINAL SURPRISE!! This novel is full of twists and inter-relationships, but NONE shocked me more than the one I found in the “Author’s Thanks” at the end! It turns out that Fredrik Backman shares an office with Niklas Natt och Dag, author of the wonderful crime novel, “The Wolf and the Watchman”, which I adore and recommend to every reader I know!

Henry's short story ""The Ransom of Red Chief"" had I encountered a fictitious hostage-taker with such tremendous  regrets . In that famous story, the kidnappers seeking ransom actually have to pay an unruly boy's father to take the kid off their hands.  Backman's ""Anxious People"" offers a different type of  irony revealed at a more deliberate pace. Backman takes readers on a roller coaster ride of emotions that people undergo in everyday disappointments in careers, marriages, and finances  and in more traumatic situations like witnessing suicides, being present at a bank robbery, or being taken hostage. Readers will encounter both pathos and humor.Backman tells the tale from the points of view of the policemen who are called to the scene, the bank robber turned hostage-taker, and the individual hostages who are attending an Open House for an apartment that is for sale.  Things are never what they seem, and Backman teases readers with slowly-revealed details that make all the difference. The bank robber's description of the hostages as the ""worst ever"" is what reminded me of O. Henry's story. Few readers could ever imagine the surprise ending. I loved it!"

Add a mystery man in the bathroom, a real estate agent, and a father-son police duo who have very different ideas of how to do things and you have a recipe for a wonderfully entertaining novel about human relationships, love, loss, and hope. And there’s a thing about a bridge and a psychologist in there somewhere too.Backman had me laughing within the first few lines of this story and I was hooked. The story brilliantly incorporates a wide range of emotions while exploring the human condition and interpersonal relationships. All within a witty dialogue and delightfully dry sarcasm. I also thoroughly enjoyed the stream of consciousness style of the writing. This is a book that would make for an amazing ensemble cast in a film or series. I found it easy to connect with each of the characters and empathize with their individual stories.A perfect weekend binge read. This one will give you the feels from beginning to end."

There are side notes, anecdotes, ""life lessons"", all thrown in with zero purpose to the plot or character development. The last five or six chapters all attempt to wrap up the characters' lives in ""happy"" ways but feels haphazard and unnecessary. Honestly, not nearly as good as everyone makes it out to be. Read it for yourself....but really don't recommend it."

At first I thought it was one of those books that just took awhile to get into. Wrong! It was more like having your teeth pulled one at a time, w/no novocaine. Very unpleasant read. It was a book club choice, so I had to read it. Hated every single moment of it, & I am a voracious reader.I would not recommend this book at all. Ugh!"
71,David Wade,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"November 26, 2020",One person found this helpful,"The story: A bank robber flees a cash-less bank and runs into an apartment that is filled with prospective buyers.The premise seems simple enough, but it becomes complicated as lives are examined, including their histories and motivations.  The story and writing were good.  The author has a unique way of writing, and he definitely knows how to hit the emotions of his readers.  Like all Backman books, it includes underlying currents of social justice, and I expect it now in his works.  Good story, good writing."
72,Leonard,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"February 1, 2021",0 people found this helpful,"The first half of Backman's book includes numerous character interviews and extended dialog between several of the main characters.  Later in the book Backman describes these people as idiots.  After reading the first half of the book, I could sum up the people of various backgrounds as crazy, not idiots.  Their conversations were contrived to be talking passed each other and the characters didn't stop to say, ""You're not responding to my statement [or question]""  During these dialogs the Backman was able to insert some of his philosophies and questions he has ruminated over about modern life.The second half of the book took on a reasonable interactions and provided the interactions that gave the bood a redeaming drama.  I'll give the book this much.  You're not likely to read another novel like it.  That is a plus."
73,Pence & Rodriguez,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"February 12, 2021",0 people found this helpful,"A Fredrik Backman novel is a warm fire, a hot cup of tea, a best friend’s voice. I have “rationed” reading his books because I don’t want to run out of books to lift me when I am low.But in the era of COVID, as I work every day to make sure my mother is vaccinated, that my business is somehow able to return, that we desperately await help from a broken country, I know I am not alone.I could be the bank robber. I could be the person desperate for 6500 dollars. My mother could be Estelle, waiting for her husband Knut to park the car. My friends could be Ro and Julia, waiting to have a baby (their 2nd actually). Who are we abandoning hoping they don’t jump off a bridge. How does this moment in history not paralyze each of us?And yet, Backman manages to infect humor into hopelessness.This book made me realize I cannot afford to ration Backman books. I don’t know what will happen tomorrow, when I will enjoy a Friday afternoon to laze on the couch with the man of my dreams .... and know we are more than our mistakes."
74,C. Henry,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"September 22, 2020",2 people found this helpful,"After the first few chapters, one would think that the book was written as a vehicle for the relentless dry wit of the author. Eventually, some purpose comes into focus between the lines. Toward the end, the purpose comes into full bloom - still cradled in the relentless wit.  The author’s characters are works of brilliance."
75,Michelle,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"November 8, 2020",0 people found this helpful,"So this was definitely different than Bear Town and not what I was expecting. Yet I liked it all the same. A bank robber situation turned hostage in an open house apartment with a crew of quirky characters who all have their own personal issues and stories. From the outside, it looks pretty cut and dry as far as what is going on and assumptions get made. Yet, once inside the apartment with the characters, it is completely different scene than what it seems. I enjoyed the thought provoking discussions involved with the humor embedded. The characters are flawed, but real and relatable. It's easy to presume things and the author does a great job of tangentially showing how people and stories interact and that everyone wants to find someone to connect to, even those who are committing a crime."
76,Melissa,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"May 6, 2021",0 people found this helpful,"This book is not what I would normally choose to read. It was a book club pick, and I admit to not being thrilled with the prospect of reading it. However, beyond the discussion and getting to know other readers through the shared experience of reading a book, the whole point of book club is to stretch into genres and authors you wouldn't otherwise try. On the whole, I'm very glad that I had the chance to read this book.Anxious People has delightful characters and a creative plot that is pieced together like a puzzle. Much like finding all of a puzzle's edge pieces first to determine it's layout, you have to be willing to stick with the story long enough to get a feel for the shape of it. The story, though funny, is rather far-fetched and the characters seem combative with each other at the start. However, Backman, who frequently breaks the fourth wall to address the reader and relate the story to them, makes it clear that the story is meant to be unbelievable and successfully manages to convince the reader to ""go with it."" With that, it's easier to suspend disbelief and, instead, focus on how the characters connect (or don't connect) as Backman weaves backward and forward in the story timeline. The end result is an immensely satisfying conclusion in which all of the pieces finally form a whole.There is nothing wrong whatsoever with this book, though I doubt that I would read it again mostly because it's not my usual go-to genre. It might put off a less committed reader (if they were not honor bound by book club to finish it). The structure of the plot jumping back and forth is integral to this story, but I can see how it might not be enjoyable for readers who enjoy a linear timeline. However, my interest is now peaked regarding Backman's other books, and I have already arranged for a watch party with my book club of the 2015 Academy Award nominated film made from his first book, A Man Called Ove.Favorite Excerpt:“The truth of course is that if people really were as happy as they look on the Internet, they wouldn't spend so much damn time on the Internet, because no one who's having a really good day spends half of it taking pictures of themselves. Anyone can nurture a myth about their life if they have enough manure, so if the grass looks greener on the other side of the fence, that's probably because it's full of shit. Not that that really makes much difference, because now we've learned that every day needs to be special. Every day.”Since it's not a book I'd likely keep on my shelf, I cannot give it my highest rating. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend Anxious People to readers who love a sentimental story with clever characters and plot organization, and I would likely also suggest it as a ""palate cleanser"" for readers who need an uplifting shift out of their genre ruts. The message of this story is sweet and valuable for any reader willing to give it a go. Backman perfectly balances the ridiculousness of the story with just the right amount and timing of humor."
77,warbler,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"October 21, 2020",0 people found this helpful,"This is a story with a very intricate plot. I read it in bits and pieces over a two-week period, which is probably not a good idea, as it is complex. It is the story of a bank robbery (yes, of a cashless bank) that, if you check police records, never happened. Huh? Who was this robber and what is the robber's story? You won't know till the very end.Initially I loved the humor. The police interviews with the dippy 20-yr old bank teller London and Zara and others are priceless. The latter stages of the novel drag a bit, as there is a lot of dialogue among the so-called hostages.  And the relationship between Zara and Nadia is difficult to comprehend. But the end is well done.Liked Beartown better, but this is a good read. Now I'm going to read Ove."

Period.I so loved ""A Man Called Ove,"" but this may even be better.  One thing is certain, I am so happy I read it.  I am amazed by Fredrik's ability to jump from one story to another, one character to another, and one hysterical happenstance to another.My mother always had what we called ""a hand grenade mind.""  Thankfully, there is at least one more."
79,Ron,2.0,Reviewed in the United States,"March 23, 2021",0 people found this helpful,"I’m in the minority here, this was just not a book I enjoyed.  There were parts of the book that kept my attention, but very few.  Humor was sprinkled through out the beginning but I kept losing momentum reading because of the jumping around of the story.  I never really got a true sense of the story, its “take away” if you will.  This is not a dig against the writer, there was some very clever pieces to the story, but it didn’t hold my attention and frankly I couldn’t wait for it to end.  The end of the book did absolutely nothing for me, but again I think it was about just wanting it to end.I can’t recommend nor will I recommend this book.  Other works from the author I enjoyed...but not this one.  Something just got lost in the translation for me."
80,Kathi,4.0,Reviewed in the United States,"October 11, 2020",One person found this helpful,"This was an engaging read but not a easy one. I found myself needing to take notes on characters throughout to keep track. It’s not a book to read in parallel with 3 others! A situation of happenstance that brings a bunch of very different people together.....you learn about each in flashbacks and stories told between them. Suicide, grief, alcoholism, loneliness, the evolution of relationships through time and what we will sacrifice for our children are major themes."
81,SeaMist105,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"February 4, 2021",0 people found this helpful,"I keep asking myself how a man who is obviously still young, and who has young children, can possibly have the level of insight into human nature that Fredrick Backman has.I laughed out loud so much that I was glad I live alone and couldn't disturb anyone else with my cackling.  I felt compassion, through the eyes of this storyteller, for every character in the book.After I finished the book, I went back and read the last 30 or 40 pages the next night, just to make sure I didn't miss any details of what happened to everyone.At an absolutely excruciatingly painful time in my life, this book brought me such joy that I've recommended it to everyone I know.  Thank you, Mr. Backman."

The people are too stupid to hold the jobs they have. I'm not sure where the guy went after he shot himself and why there wasn't a trail of blood leading the cops to him....and then I didn't care.The Bank Teller, in reality, would not be able to hold a job in any field the way she was written. To me a character, written as dumb or as sarcastic as possible, still has to hold a level of probability of existence in the real world. Otherwise it's just a cartoon, and this book is not supposed to be a cartoon.Is it?"
85,S. Vanhoose,5.0,Reviewed in the United States,"January 6, 2021",0 people found this helpful,"I loved Ove, so decided to pick this up as my next book to read.  This was probably one of my favorite books I have read in a long time!  Wow!  The author has this amazing knack of keeping a story silly and lighthearted and quirky while at the same time dealing with deep truths of human life and psychology.  He balances this amazingly throughout the book.  I will say that if you are triggered by a nasty divorce or by suicide themes, read with care.  But otherwise it is just a fabulously written book with a very unique plot line and a very unique style that combines goofy, almost trite at times, humor with some very realistic and serious life issues.  READ THIS."

I was afraid it would persist throughout the novel, and I felt a little pandered to.Fortunately, the lightheartedness is there to balance out the serious nature of what is really being discussed. The moments of humor, too silly to ever be real, are there to balance the awful reality of depression, anxiety, divorce, death, loneliness, guilt, and suicide.This is a book that begs to be read twice, as there is much to revisit through new eyes.I read this 3 days loo late to be chosen for my yearly pick for book club.

I have been having a hard time reading books these past few months. Then along comes this book.  I was a bit confused at the beginning where different people and stories were presented. Then the larger story unfolds. F Backman has an amazing ability to let us get to know his characters.We learn their quirks or flaws and coping mechanisms.  Then he lets us see their relationships with one another. It's not long until you look forward to reading and wanting to be with the characters and knowing what happens.  Here is a heart warming story that isn't sappy but very satisfying. Highly recommend."

At the end you discover the reason for their behavior but it was just too much. I believe 100 less pages would have been perfect.

My favorite part of the story is when three ladies are in the walk in closet having a heart to heart conversation.

I found the book funny, clever, often bewildering, even frustrating but also charming and, ultimately, really smart. Smart is what kept me going and, with each page, I became more invested in the wonderful characters. Towards the ending, it was gratitude I felt toward Fredric Backman for his generosity, his quiet joy and deep angst; his gift of sharing the truths we all experience daily in our lives. He snuck up on me. I found myself teary-eyed and with new perspective or, perhaps renewed perspective , as I finished this book. “Anxious People” is a gift to us all."

A few turn out to be more than one-hit wonders, but only a small handful are true masters of their craft. They can tell a story that makes you laugh and wonder and cry and cringe; they can make their readers see themselves in every character they create; they somehow use just the right words in just the right order, no more, no less, and weave a tale that is powerful and perfect.Mr. Backman has done it again with “Anxious People”.

I would recommend this to anyone who reads ... it’s a story about us all. We could identify with any one or more of the circumstances and people in the book.We just have to keep moving on in life always doing our best and believe that we are doing our best."
