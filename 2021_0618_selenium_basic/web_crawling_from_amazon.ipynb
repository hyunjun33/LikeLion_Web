      "comment:  the beginning of the story was nice, that's why I bought it, but then it goes into the same thing over and over again. You know after the first 20 pages what's going on and then it drags along. You wait for something to happen, but it comes back to the same thing, over and over. The ending is a little bit surprising, if as somebody would have said, 'please put  at least some spice to the ending, otherwise you can forget the book'. I read OVE from this author and kind of liked it. This was another reason to buy it, but somehow his style is repeating. It was in certain respect OVE with different people. For me it was the last book I read from him. Maybe he can only write one thing. A good author should be more versatile.\n",

      "comment:  This author has a great talent and I will read anything he writes.I loved, loved A Man Called Ov so maybe my expectations were set a little too high on Anxious People. I did enjoy this book a great deal and would recommend it to anyone. The concept is unique, a bank robbery investigated by a father and son and their conflicts. This would’ve been five stars had the backstory of “The bank robber,” not been in second person. This structure not only stopped the forward motion of the story but for me it was like fingernails on a chalkboard. I have no problem with first person, third person and third person close, second person tossed me out of the story and held me at arm’s length.In the first part of the book the author doesn’t stay with anyone character long enough for the reader to relate to them. For me this is critically important for establishing what I need most out of a book, The Fictive Dream, a state where I become immersed in the story. During the opening pages of most books authors are tasked with endearing the reader to the character, what I’ve heard described as, “Patting the head of the dog.”The big reason this book works and is so popular is the author’s credibility, he is a wonderful talent who readers trust implicitly and are willing to give him a few pages to set up the story. The book really digs in on page 107 so hold out a little longer if tempted to put it down, you won’t regret it. Four out of five stars.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson Series\n",

      "comment:  In a time that feels like we are more distant that ever from each - Backman reminds us of the goodness of humanity.  I am an avid reader and Backman's books are by far my favorite - this book is no exception.  While this one took me a while to get into due to the narrative style - I soon could not put it down.  As others have mentioned - this is not the story of a kidnapping but about kindness among strangers.  Read it - you will not regret it.\n",

      "comment:  Not since I read O. Henry's short story \"The Ransom of Red Chief\" had I encountered a fictitious hostage-taker with such tremendous  regrets . In that famous story, the kidnappers seeking ransom actually have to pay an unruly boy's father to take the kid off their hands.  Backman's \"Anxious People\" offers a different type of  irony revealed at a more deliberate pace. Backman takes readers on a roller coaster ride of emotions that people undergo in everyday disappointments in careers, marriages, and finances  and in more traumatic situations like witnessing suicides, being present at a bank robbery, or being taken hostage. Readers will encounter both pathos and humor.Backman tells the tale from the points of view of the policemen who are called to the scene, the bank robber turned hostage-taker, and the individual hostages who are attending an Open House for an apartment that is for sale.  Things are never what they seem, and Backman teases readers with slowly-revealed details that make all the difference. The bank robber's description of the hostages as the \"worst ever\" is what reminded me of O. Henry's story. Few readers could ever imagine the surprise ending. I loved it!\n",

      "comment:  I’m in the minority here, this was just not a book I enjoyed.  There were parts of the book that kept my attention, but very few.  Humor was sprinkled through out the beginning but I kept losing momentum reading because of the jumping around of the story.  I never really got a true sense of the story, its “take away” if you will.  This is not a dig against the writer, there was some very clever pieces to the story, but it didn’t hold my attention and frankly I couldn’t wait for it to end.  The end of the book did absolutely nothing for me, but again I think it was about just wanting it to end.I can’t recommend nor will I recommend this book.  Other works from the author I enjoyed...but not this one.  Something just got lost in the translation for me.\n",

      "comment:  It started of as a simple disconnected story, I thought the dots would never connect and it’s a very superficial read.It made a about turn a third of the way and then kept becoming engrossing and with so much depth, one could drown trying to decipher the meaning.Has a lot of truth to what some may call cliches. I would recommend this to anyone who reads ... it’s a story about us all. We could identify with any one or more of the circumstances and people in the book.We just have to keep moving on in life always doing our best and believe that we are doing our best.\n",
